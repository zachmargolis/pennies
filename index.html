      <h1>Pennies!</h1>

      <p>This is the change that my family and I have found in every year since 2017. It's our friendly little competition, and everyone's a winner (and I'm the biggest winner).</p>

      <h2>
        Results
      </h2>

      <p>Total coins picked up, year-over-year</p>

      <div class="year-over-year"></div>

      <h2>
        By Year
        <ul class="year-selector"></ul>
      </h2>

      <div class="by-person"></div>

      <h3>Timeline</h3>

      <div class="by-time overflow-x-scroll overflow-x-padding"></div>

      <ul class="coin-legend no-bullet"></ul>

      <h3 class="clearfix">By Coin</h3>

      <div class="by-coin-table overflow-x-scroll"></div>

      <h2>Methodology</h2>

      <p>We take pictures of coins we find on the ground (either in situ or once they've been picked up) and then message the pictures each other. Almost all change is fair game, but we don't allow fishing in fountains (deliberately left change).</p>

      <p>Each year, I manually scrolled through our message history and log the results in a spreadsheet. I lightly process and turned that spreadsheet into a CSV used to power these visualizations. Most of the time we text what coins we find (such as "a scuffed penny") but some of the coins were ambiguous so I took a guess (a blurry dime and nickel with no reference are hard to tell apart).</p>
